<p> We are plan to develop a website where any user can search for nearest location of emergency services 
like nearest hospital,ambulance,police station,fire services etc. just by searching their location.
any user can contribute for the site by adding information into database but that will require admin verification,
 validate/reject the information ,it will be added/removed from the main database.
